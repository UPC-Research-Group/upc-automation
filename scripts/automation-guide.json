UPC Automation Guide

This guide explains the automation scripts in the UPC Automation repository, designed to support metadata validation, OSF uploads, and workflow consistency.

Purpose
Automatically validate metadata files
Assist with OSF uploads (future scripts)
Maintain consistency across UPC repositories
Automate repetitive tasks like versioning checks and naming validation

Folder Structure
/scripts/
    validate_metadata.py    → Validate required metadata fields
    osf_upload.py           → (optional future OSF upload script)

/docs/
    automation-guide.md     → This guide

Using validate_metadata.py

Run the script:
python scripts/validate_metadata.py path/to/metadata.json


Checks performed:
Required fields:
title
abstract
keywords
version
license (must be CC-BY-4.0)
Outputs:
“Valid metadata” if all fields are present
List of missing fields if any are absent
Workflow Integration
Contributor updates repository files
Runs validator script locally
PR reviewer checks the output
Merge only after validation passes
This ensures strict quality control without manual checking.

Future Enhancements
osf_upload.py: automate uploads to OSF
Batch validation for multiple files
Logging and reporting validation results
